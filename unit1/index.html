<h1>ABOUT ME</h1>
<p>I am a semi-trailer salesman and importer living in <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Edmonton">Edmonton, Alberta, Canada</a>. I became interested in front-end web design and development because I always have ideas for really cool web based projects but lack the skillset to commercialize them. I see myself more as a project leader than a full time coder, so my main interest in studying this content comes in the form of being able to communicate with my future project teammates clearly as we start working on <strong>BIG</strong> things!</p>

<h2>My Mission<h2>
<p>As I learn more about front-end, I hope to one day work as a mobile app developer with my own hand picked team because I like to work in creative and dynamic environments, populated by brilliant, interesting, curious, hard working, creative, and really fun people!</p>
